// TransporterRamp has additional functionallity

// The car transport ramp has only two positions, up or down.
// The ramp can only be down if the car transport is stationary. 
// If the ramp is down, the car transport must not move, and if the car transport is moving, the ramp must not be lowered.
// Cars can only be loaded if the ramp is down, and they are reasonably close to the car transport (make your own assumption about what "reasonably close" means, the details are not important).
// Cars can only be unloaded if the ramp is down. They should then end up reasonably close to the car transport.
